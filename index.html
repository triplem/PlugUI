        <h1>PlugUI 2</h1>

<p>PlugUI 2 is a file management and system admin web interface for small ARM based devices running Arch Linux ARM. </p>

<p>It will run on other distros, but the package manager is right now geared to use pacman. We are going to provide a specific module for pacman, so that this could be removed and 
replaced with a different one, but this is not going to be developed by us (at least in the near future).</p>

<p>The current version is under high development, it is a rewrite of the older PlugUI code (which was python), using Node.js. The older code is still in this repo in the django branch.</p>
