        <p>
          PlugUI 2 is a system admin web interface for small ARM based devices running Arch Linux ARM. It is based on the <a href="https://github.com/archlinuxarm/PlugUI">PlugUI module</a> of the <a href="http://archlinuxarm.org">ArchLinux ARM</a> community. They have decided to 
          use NodeJS instead of an older Python implementation (see branch django in their github-repository). Therfore the whole system is now
          programmed in Javascript.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are trying to establish this PlugUI as the de-facto standard admin interface for the ArchLinux ARM plattform. There are a couple of alternatives, which are not really "applicable" for the ArchLinux plattform (see Tonido Apps, RaspControl, ...), and we are going to make
          a better application and fully support the alarm system.  
        </p>

        <p>
          It should run on other distros, but the package manager is right now geared to use pacman. The system is pretty much modularized, so that it should be possible to use other package managers as well, but this is not going to be developed by us (at least in the near future).
        </p>

        <p>
          The current version is under high development, it is a rewrite of the older PlugUI code, using Node.js. The older code is still in this repo in the django branch.
        </p>
